    <h2>Poem:</h2>
    <p>
      "I earn my living.<br>
      I make enough to get by <br>
      and it takes all my time. <br>
      If I had more time <br>
      I could do more for myself <br>
      and maybe for others. <br>
      I could read and study <br>
      and talk things over <br>
      and find out about things. <br>
      It takes time. <br>
      I wish I had the time." <br>
      - Excerpted from Carl Sandburg's "The People Yes"
